I did the extra credit that required that we generate the 15 separation planes. The SAT function calculates whether there is no collision, and it also returns which axis is seperating the OBBs. Not only that but the application says which axis is the one seperating the models. The seperation planes are also drawn between the two models. In the case of the cross axis tests I wasn't entirely sure what the example solution program was doing and the assignment document didn't elaborate, so I just tried to replicate it to the best of my ability by using yellow planes.
